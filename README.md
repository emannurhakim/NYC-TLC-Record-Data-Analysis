# NYC-TLC-Record-Data-Analysis

The NYC TLC Trip Record Dataset provides detailed historical data on taxi and for-hire vehicle (FHV) trips in New York City. Released by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), this dataset includes millions of records covering trips made by yellow taxis, green taxis, and ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.

Each record typically contains information about the pickup and drop-off times and locations, trip distance, fare details, payment type, and other key attributes related to the ride. The dataset spans across all five NYC boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island—and is updated regularly.

This analysis provides valuable insights for taxi fleet operators and dispatch companies to:

- Optimize fleet distribution by identifying high-demand pickup zones and peak operating hours.

- Enhance operational efficiency through understanding trip durations, idle times, and distance-based performance.

- Monitor customer behavior and preferences, such as preferred payment methods (cash vs. card) and average trip fares.

- Evaluate revenue trends across different boroughs, days of the week, and hours of the day to support pricing strategies and driver incentives.

The objective of this analysis is to uncover key operational insights from trip, revenue, and payment data in order to:

- Identify spatial and temporal trip patterns across New York City boroughs.

- Analyze tipping behavior and payment type dynamics to improve driver earnings.

- Improve fleet distribution and utilization by reducing demand overconcentration in specific zones.

- Develop actionable strategies to increase efficiency, revenue, and equity in service coverage.

Despite a strong trip volume and centralized performance, several key operational inefficiencies limit overall service optimization:

1. Zone Congestion & Imbalance:
    -   A disproportionate concentration of trips in East Harlem and Manhattan leads to overcrowding in some zones while other boroughs like Staten Island and EWR remain underutilized, resulting in inefficient   resource allocation.

2. Low Tipping Potential in Certain Scenarios:
    - Tipping is largely driven by credit card usage and shorter trips, while cash payments and longer rides tend to yield little to no tip, affecting driver motivation and earnings consistency.

3. Limited Multi-Passenger Engagement:
    - The dominance of solo trips leads to low vehicle occupancy and inefficient ride distribution, especially during high-demand periods.

4. Underperformance in Outer Boroughs:
    - Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island show low revenue and trip counts, indicating gaps in service adoption or demand stimulation.

5. Overreliance on Digital Payment Zones:
    - While digital payments increase revenue, they are heavily concentrated in high-traffic zones, causing potential tip revenue loss in cash-preferred areas.
